# sp0ck

i thought i lost this code, but thankfully somebody forked it before i deleted from github.

thank you so much @applikelo !

## what it does

it is a version of the incoginto web proxy that i stripped down for some personal projects back in 2023 (2022 maybe?)

to run simply 

```git clone https://github.com/virgilholmes/sp0ck```

```npm install```

```npm run start```
